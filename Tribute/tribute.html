                    Still I am walking on my way, still i am finding the way to live this life without You, Do you knwo why? cause the blood running through my veins is Yours. That Man's blood who lived a fearless life, 
                    The man to whom the "Strength Word belongs". Then How will be his girl get lost in her life!!! I never felt like u are not with me. As because u never made me feel like so.
                    i am just surrounded by your beautiful aura, and essence. My words are not enough to define you infront this world. BECAUSE YOU WERE ONE, YOU ARE ONE, AND ALWAYSBE THE ONE... Special, the most special person of my life, of my soul...
                    I won't ever be able to describe you, But lastly I wanna say We just love you...
